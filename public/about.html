<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hey! Everyone I am a student currently of age 18, from India. Currently I am pursuing my BTECH in computer science 
  and technology field.
</p>

<p>I am much passionate about this field and want to do something big through it so i have enrolled in this course 
  to learn Web Devolupment for the first time in my life.
</p>

<p>Currently the course is going smooth but I can ensure myself that when it becomes hard I will put more excessive 
  efforts to polish my skills and have a good understanding of the field Web Devolupment. This is my first skill
  that I have started to learn in CSE field.
  <br/>Thank You.
